This work is in collaboration with a group in the Civil Engineering department at TTU.

## User Story
Our domain analyst wants to see wells that have high sudden saturated thickness increase. He will go to the tool, from Control panel, for the **Well radius by**
option, he chooses **Sudden increase**. Just one selection, he immediately gets list of wells with highest sudden saturated thickness increase.
Then he wants to see time period of a particular well that has this change, he just needs to do mouse over a well on time series chart legend.
And the Comparison graph will appear with two points flickering telling the period of this big increase.
He makes mouse over each point, the date of this measurement and its saturated thickness value will be shown up.
